npm is also a software Package Manager and Installer

The name npm (Node Package Manager) stems from when npm first was created as a package manager for Node.js.
All npm packages are defined in files called package.json.

We can start a node.js file simply typing  on the terminal "npm init"

We can install libraries with npm, 
eg, If we want to install nodemon, we have to type "npm i nodemon" 
(i stands for install)
